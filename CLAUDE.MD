# Project AI Collaboration Protocol

## Purpose
This project is designed to maximize overall quality and maintainability by actively collaborating with Gemini CLI throughout all development phases.

- Project contributors are expected to utilize Gemini CLI for:
    - Code generation and review
    - Automated documentation
    - Workflow optimization (e.g., using MCP or integrated pipelines)
    - Error analysis and test automation
- All major features, bug fixes, and documentation tasks should incorporate Gemini CLI’s insights and code templates where appropriate.

## File Location
- Place this `CLAUDE.md` file in the root directory of your project repository.
- Include it in version control to ensure every team member follows a consistent, AI-integrated workflow.
